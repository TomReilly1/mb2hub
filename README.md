<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project

MB2 Hub aims to be a online reference for any data or statistics that pertain to Mount&Blade II: Bannerlord. This project is a work-in-progress, so I am continously trying to add more concepts and functionality. Also, because Bannerlord is in early access and moves at a relatively quick pace, I will try to keep the webiste updated to the beta version.
